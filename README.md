# Arduino Radar System

This project simulates a basic radar system using an Arduino UNO, an ultrasonic sensor, a servo motor, LEDs, and a buzzer. The sensor scans the surrounding area and detects objects based on distance. The output is visualized through LEDs, sound alerts, and an optional radar-like interface using the Processing IDE.

##  How It Works

- The **ultrasonic sensor** sends sound waves and detects objects based on echo timing.
- The **servo motor** moves the sensor from side to side (0¬∞‚Äì180¬∞).
- When an object is detected:
  - **Red LED** blinks
  - **Buzzer** sounds
  - Data is sent to a radar-like visual on the **Processing IDE** (optional).
- A **slide switch** turns the radar system on and off.
- **Green LED** shows when the system is actively scanning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/download).
2. Wire components as per the circuit diagram.
3. Upload Arduino code via USB.
4. Open Processing IDE and adjust:
   - Line 24: Set display resolution
   - Line 26: Set correct COM port
5. Run both sketches to start the radar system.
